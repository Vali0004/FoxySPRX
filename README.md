# FoxySPRX
 A base written from scratch inspired by modern bases.
# What's different? Why FoxySPRX?
 * To start off, I implemented lots of ease-of-life defines. I wrote STD-like implementations of the most commonly used stdlib things. I added lots of other very useful things such as math implementations (stuff like sin, cos, tan and others)
 * The whole menu has a everloving shitload of customisation. I'm not sure, but it might be the most amount of customisation in a PS3 menu base. You can literally edit the whole menu without ever touching the source, as the ability to remove elements was added. I made sure all the math was dynamic, and easy to understand.
 * It uses lots of modern C++ standard things.
 * The code is extremely easy to understand.
 * This base works on RPCS3 (I have zero clue why, likely because I developed using RPCS3 bc good debugger. COBRA CFW like Evilnat 4.90 is required, and a modified EBOOT.BIN ofc)
# A huge thanks
 * Pliskin, someone who was so helpful when no one else was. He gave me lots of very useful tips on things only someone well versed in the PS3 would know. He also gave lots of extremely useful tools. You're the best. Love you, man.
 * Gopro2027, for open sourcing his Paradise project. There's a reason I said "I added" instead of "I wrote", as I snagged some math functions from Paradise. Sorry about that, lol.
 * A forgotten mention, the 3TA Online team. Without them, this wouldn't have been possible. Thanks for bringing back memories of the old Grand Theft Auto Online. It was gone too soon.
# Where to contact me
 * Discord is the way to go, Vali#0004 is my handle.
 * However, I do have a social page with all my other contact info.
 * Vist me at https://spacehey.com/vali0004
# Some extra notes for those wondering
 * I know some of you are confused where my DS4 support sprx is, and, I lost it. My third drive kinda died. I'm working on rewriting it for this base as I am writing this readme. I will update this when I have added it.
* There may still be bugs, as it's not 100%. I will try my best to ensure there isn't any, but I cannot make any promises. Please, feel free to make a issue for any bug. If you fix it, make a pull request if you can.
